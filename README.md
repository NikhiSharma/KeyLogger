# KeyLogger provides the information about what keys a user has pressed at a particular period of usage in a computer.
This is very useful for the sake of footprinting and reconnoisance. The code is pretty clear and the data of the keys pressed will be stored in a text document called log.txt
which has to be created beside this file.
